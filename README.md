IPL_Project

Description:
In this project, Data will be read from a raw CSV file and stored in a List of String arrays using openCSV library.

Scenario 1:
From stored data find the number of matches played per year of all the years in IPL.

Scenario 2:
Number of matches won of all teams over all the years of IPL from csv file.

These two scenarios are interconnected and can be solved with same method.

Scenario 3:
Extra runs conceded per team in 2016. File_1 contains year and file_2 contains extra runs.
so, finding the corresponding first and last match id of the year and their indices in file_2 using binary search and loops
then combined them to find the extra runs.

scenario 4:
For the year 2015 get the top economical bowlers. Balls thrown by bowler has calculated excluding wides and noballs as they were 
not included to calculate economy of bowler ans stored in hashmap. Along with that runs conceded by each bowler was calculated and stored
in another hashmap. Finally calculated economy by run conceded/no of overs .stored it in hashmap and sorted it.

Scenario 5:
For given year, we can find the no of matches happened.
